            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I worked at BCcampus, a publically-funded organization that uses information technology to improve teaching and learning in BC's universities and colleges, between January &ndash; August of 2013. During my first three months, I worked on a usability test for our corporate website to find out whether our audience could perform typical tasks on our website easily, and to discover the usability problems of our site.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                I worked individually for most of this project, being involved with the usability testing from start to finish. I had several responsibilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Understanding Our Users</h3>
            <p>
                Given existing data from internal reports from BCcampus, I knew that the target audience of the BCcampus.ca website included faculty, other education workers, and administrators. I needed to break down the target audience further, and get to know what tasks are most important to each segment of the target audience.

                <li>Other educational staff (e.g., instructional designers, librarians)</li>
