# IAT 339 Project 04: Portfolio

**Portfolio link: [http://iat339dev.kevinchoy.ca/](http://iat339dev.kevinchoy.ca/)**

**Style guide: [http://iat339dev.kevinchoy.ca/style-guide/](http://iat339dev.kevinchoy.ca/style-guide/)**

Portfolio site that incorporates the Kirby CMS. Design is somewhat influenced by my old (current) portfolio, which can be found at [http://kevinchoy.ca/](http://kevinchoy.ca/). The site uses the Kirby content management system from Project 03.

The newest contents are located in the **kirby** folder. An older version of the site, which uses HTML/CSS only (no Kirby, and therefore no need run on a server), is located in the **old-work** folder.
