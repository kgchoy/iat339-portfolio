Title: About Me

----

About-Section:

I'm a student from Vancouver, British Columbia, currently studying at Simon Fraser University where I am majoring in Interactive Arts &amp; Technology with a concentration in Interactive Systems and minoring in Computing Science. My related academic interests include user experience design and interaction design.

My design philosophy is guided by minimalism and simplicity, where I believe that the aesthetic aspect of a product should be secondary to functional considerations. Elements should not be flashy without reason.

I have also had a lifelong interest in the study of human geography&mdash;particularly urban studies and the geography of transportation. This, too, has shaped my creative design process, as well as the types of design topics I explore.

In my spare time, I also enjoy activities such as hiking, board &amp; tabletop games, badminton, and retrogaming. I am an active member and executive of the Burnaby Mountain Toastmasters public speaking club.
